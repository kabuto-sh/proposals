## Abstract

Issuance of:

- 138,962.33082293ℏ from 0.0.1443164 (DEV) -> 0.0.40834
- 69,529.02287807ℏ from 0.0.1443163 (TLD for .ℏ & .hh) -> 0.0.40834
- 82,570.031664692973893ℏ ($7,301.20 x $0.088424333293819/ℏ) from 0.0.1443162 (INFRA) -> 0.0.40834

## Rationale

LaunchBadge has been the sole developer on KNS. LaunchBadge exercises its right to withdraw funds from the DEV account.

LaunchBadge is the administrator for the .ℏ and .hh TLDs. All funds in the TLD account have been derived from these two TLDs. LaunchBadge exercises its right to withdraw funds from the TLD account.

LaunchBadge has maintained the official KNS resolver on Google Cloud Compute for 13 full months. Infrastructure for the KNS resolver incurred a cost of approximately $495 to $847 each month for a total of $7,301.20 of approximately 13 months. LaunchBadge exercises its right to withdraw funds from the INFRA account to cover that cost at the price of $0.088424333293819 per hbar which is the price on 2024-01-04.
